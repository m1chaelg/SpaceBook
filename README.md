Linter:
Using the google config with eslint:recommended
Used the google one as it wasn't as obtrusive as the others and was easy to implement
It was mainly followed by using ESLint to fix and highlight any errors that needed to be fixed manually.

UI Style:
Started using bootstrap, but barely made any difference and I liked the standard components with my own styling.
